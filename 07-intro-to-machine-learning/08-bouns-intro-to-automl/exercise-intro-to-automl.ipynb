The competition is simple: we want you to use 79 different explanatory variables (such as the type of roof, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms) to predict home prices.\n\n# Note\n\nBefore we begin, an important note! \n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<b>Note</b>: Google Cloud AutoML Tables is a <b>paid service</b>. At the time of publishing, it charges \\$19.32 per hour of compute during training and \\$1.16 per hour of compute for batch prediction.  You can find more details <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/pricing\"><b>here</b></a>.  \n</div><br> \n\nFurthermore, this notebook is **optional** and does not have to be completed to get full credit for the **[Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)** course.\n\n# Set up the notebook\n\nTo begin, we'll need to make sure that your notebook is set up to run the code.  Begin by looking at the **\"Settings\"** menu to the right of your notebook.  Your menu will look like one of the following:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kR1az0y.png\" width=100%><br/>\n</center>\n\nIf your **\"Internet\"** setting appears as a **\"Requires phone verification\"** link, click on this link.  This will bring you to a new window; then, follow the instructions to verify your account.  After following this step, your **\"Internet\"** setting will appear **\"Off\"**, as in the example to the right.\n\nOnce your **\"Internet\"** setting appears as **\"Off\"**, click to turn it on.  You'll see a pop-up window that you'll need to **\"Accept\"** in order to complete the process and have the setting switched to **\"On\"**.  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gOVh6Aa.png\" width=100%><br/>\n</center>\n\nOnce you have followed the steps above, you're ready to proceed!"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"\n# Set up Google Cloud\n\nNext, create a Google Cloud account by following the instructions **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/get-started-with-google-cloud-platform)**.  You'll also learn how to claim $300 of free credits!\n\nThen, connect your Google Cloud account to this notebook by selecting **Add-ons > Google Cloud Services**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UHB4P5o.png)\n\nIn the pop-up window, select **Cloud Storage** and **AutoML (beta)**.  Then click on **Link Account**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IlbdbHD.png)\n\nYou'll see another pop-up that tells you about Google AutoML pricing.  Once you have reviewed this information, click on **ENABLE**.  Then, sign in with the e-mail address that is linked to your Google Cloud account.  \n\nOnce your account is attached to the notebook, you can close the pop-up.\n\n# Get started with AutoML\n\nWe have supplied values for the following variables for you:\n- `DATASET_DISPLAY_NAME` - The name of your dataset (should use at most 32 characters; allowed characters: ASCII Latin letters A-Z and a-z, an underscore (\"\\_\"), and ASCII digits 0-9).  \n- `TRAIN_FILEPATH` - The filepath for the training data (`train.csv` file) from the competition.\n- `TEST_FILEPATH` - The filepath for the test data (`test.csv` file) from the competition.\n- `TARGET_COLUMN` - The name of the column in your training data that contains the values you'd like to predict.\n- `ID_COLUMN` - The name of the column containing IDs.\n- `MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME` - The name of your model (should use at most 32 characters; allowed characters: ASCII Latin letters A-Z and a-z, an underscore (\"\\_\"), and ASCII digits 0-9).\n- `TRAIN_BUDGET` - How long you want your model to train (use 1000 for 1 hour, 2000 for 2 hours, and so on).  In this case, since we filled in a value of 2000, the model will train for up to two hours.  **At the time of publishing, AutoML charges $19.32 for each hour of training.**  For some general guidelines about how to select this value, check out the notes on training budget at [this link](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs/train).\n\nYou'll need to fill in values for:\n- `PROJECT_ID` -  The project ID you created when following the instructions to create a Google Cloud account.  \n- `BUCKET_NAME` - The name of your [Google Cloud storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).  In order to work with AutoML, we'll need to create a storage bucket, where we'll upload the Kaggle dataset.  Running the code cell will create the bucket for you.  Use these guidelines when creating a bucket name:\n  - Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (\"-\"), and underscores (\"_\"). Spaces are not allowed. \n  - Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.\n  - Bucket names must contain 3-63 characters. \n\nOnce you've done that, run the code cell."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# TODO: Fill in your project ID and bucket name\nPROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id-here'\nBUCKET_NAME = 'your-bucket-name-here'\n\n# Do not change: Fill in the remaining variables\nDATASET_DISPLAY_NAME = 'house_prices_dataset'\nTRAIN_FILEPATH = \"../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv\"\nTEST_FILEPATH = \"../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/test.csv\"\nTARGET_COLUMN = 'SalePrice'\nID_COLUMN = 'Id'\nMODEL_DISPLAY_NAME = 'house_prices_model'\nTRAIN_BUDGET = 2000\n\n# Do not change: Create an instance of the wrapper\nfrom automl_tables_wrapper import AutoMLTablesWrapper\n\namw = AutoMLTablesWrapper(project_id=PROJECT_ID,\n                          bucket_name=BUCKET_NAME,\n                          dataset_display_name=DATASET_DISPLAY_NAME,\n                          train_filepath=TRAIN_FILEPATH,\n                          test_filepath=TEST_FILEPATH,\n                          target_column=TARGET_COLUMN,\n                          id_column=ID_COLUMN,\n                          model_display_name=MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME,\n                          train_budget=TRAIN_BUDGET)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Once you get a `Ready to train model.` result, you're ready to move on!\n\nThe next step is to commit your notebook.\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<b>Note</b>: You should not run the next code cell before committing your notebook.
